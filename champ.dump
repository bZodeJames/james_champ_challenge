4	Post 4	I'm out of ideas for posts.

1	My First Post!	In this first post I wanted to talk about getting my start in Ruby on Rails.  When I first started I knew next to nothing in Ruby.  But I quickly learned that practice makes perfect. I started out only using Scaffolds, and then moved to resource generators to reduce the amount of code inside my app.  From there I started creating at least 1 rails app a week for 12 straight weeks. 	t	2018-01-03 23:44:48.974564	2018-01-04 02:34:31.291323	5040
2	Hello World! My Second Post!	I remember the first time I installed a wordpress app, the words "Hello World" were in my first post.  I hardly understood what was happening, what those two simple words really meant.  But I quickly discovered just how much those words really can mean when you release your hard work to the world! \r\n\r\nHello world!	t	2018-01-03 23:46:48.548744	2018-01-04 02:39:37.678224	24
3	Rails! Associations!	If at first you use HABTM (has_and_belongs_to_many), then try, try again.  \r\nOne of my favorite moments of developing in Rails was discovering the strength and power of associations.   When I first wanted to create a CRM application I had the User, and Account models.  I wanted to allow users to have many accounts, and accounts to have many users...It wasn't long before I was up and running by using HABTM...or so I thought.  HABTM was not flexible, and lacked what I was really hoping to accomplish. \r\n\r\nBefore long I was using has_many :through and my world was changed.  I unlocked the power of AWESOME!\r\n\r\nSince then each new model has required different associations, and it has been a journey of fun!\r\n	t	2018-01-03 23:52:29.427775	2018-01-04 02:39:44.5255	40320
